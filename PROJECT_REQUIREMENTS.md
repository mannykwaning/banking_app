# AI-Driven Development Test: Production-Ready Banking REST Service

## OVERVIEW

Your task is to develop a REST service for a banking use case. To complete this efficiently, you are required to use AI-driven development practices. This assessment measures your ability to leverage AI tools to design and implement a banking service, as well as your capability to deliver production-grade features using AI-assisted workflows.

## Project Requirements

### Core Components: You must develop the following components

1. **Service Interface**
   - [ ] Signing up
   - [ ] Authentication
   - [ ] Account Holders
   - [ ] Accounts
   - [ ] Transactions
   - [ ] Money Transfer
   - [ ] Cards
   - [ ] Statements

2. **Database** (using SQLite)
   - [X] Database implementation

3. **Test Suite**
   - [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for critical functionality
   - [ ] Unit tests for business logic
   - [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints

4. **Containerization**
   - [ ] Dockerfile for the application
   - [ ] docker-compose.yml for local development
   - [ ] Environment variable configuration
   - [ ] Multi-stage builds (bonus)

5. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - [ ] Structured logging implementation
   - [ ] Log levels and formatting
   - [ ] Error tracking and reporting

6. **Health Checks**
   - [ ] Health check endpoint
   - [ ] Database connectivity checks
   - [ ] Service readiness probes
   - [ ] Graceful shutdown handling

### Technology Stack

- Your choices of technologies will be judged against the nature of the application and how effective those technologies are in modern software development ecosystems

### Getting Started

1. Begin development using your AI tools of choice

### Deliverables

1. **Source Code**
   - [ ] All components (service, database, tests, containers) in organized directories
   - [ ] Comprehensive test suite with good coverage
   - [ ] Docker configuration files
   - [ ] Configuration files for different environments

2. **Documentation**
   - [ ] README.md with setup instructions, API documentation, and deployment guide
   - [ ] Security considerations document
   - [ ] Future considerations/roadmap document
   - [ ] Docker deployment instructions

3. **AI Usage Report**
   - [ ] Tools used (Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot, etc.)
   - [ ] Example prompts and iterations
   - [ ] Challenges faced and how AI helped solve them
   - [ ] Areas where manual intervention was necessary

4. **Bonus Points**
   - [ ] Test client application demonstrating the flow
   - [ ] Simple frontend interface

### Ways of Working

1. Commit regularly with meaningful messages
2. Include your AI usage log as a Markdown file

### Additional Notes

- [ ] You MUST use any AI tools available to you
- [ ] External libraries and frameworks are allowed
- [ ] Focus on demonstrating effective AI-driven development
- [ ] Partial implementations are acceptable if well-documented
- [ ] Security is paramount - ensure no secrets are committed
- [ ] Test suite is a hard requirement - demonstrate testing best practices
- [ ] Production readiness is key - show understanding of operational concerns
